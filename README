## 📋 Overview
An AI-based assistant that generates SQL queries based on user input and displays the desired output.  
This project is an upgrade to my previous project on customer segmentation, now powered by **Google Gemini API** and **Streamlit** for interactive querying.

├── customers.db      # Not uploaded (auto-generated when loading the CSV)
├── load\_data.py     # One-time data cleaning and DB insertion
├── OnlineRetail.csv  # Dataset (available on Kaggle)
├── README.md         # We are here!!!

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

### 1. 📦 Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 2. 📁 Prepare the database

Make sure you have `OnlineRetail.csv` in the project folder you can [download it from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayuv/onlineretail)
Then run:


```bash
python sql.py
python load_data.py
```

This creates the table and loads the cleaned data into a local SQLite database `customers.db`.

### 3. 🚀 Launch the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the app in your browser via the link in terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## 💬 Example Questions to Ask

* How many total transactions are there?
* What is the total revenue?
* Show all records from United Kingdom.
* List all transactions with quantity greater than 50.
* Which customer made the highest purchase?

The app will convert these into SQL queries using Gemini and fetch results from the database.

## 🔐 API Key Note

The Google Gemini API key is currently **hardcoded in `app.py`**.
You can optionally switch to using `.env` and `os.getenv()` for better security.
